\section*{Projects}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
    Parallel Laplacian Solver
    $\mid$
    Prof. Amitabha Bagchi
    \hfill
    AUG $2019$

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item
            Implemented a \textbf{random-walk distributed} method to solve an
            important class of Laplacian Systems.
        \item
            Experimented with various \textbf{optimizations} and used
            \textbf{Alias Method} to successfully improve performance.
        \item
            Written and tested in C++; used OpenMP application programming
            interface for parallelization.
    \end{itemize}

\item
    Public Credit Registry
    $\mid$
    Prof. Subhashis Banerjee, Prof. Subodh Sharma
    \hfill
    MAY $2019$

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item
            Logical representation of data privacy, security and other
            correctness properties in first order logic.
        \item
            Propose a complete example of a design with unit tests and
            end-to-end testing of the model.
        \item
            Design employs blockchain technology similar to \textbf{Hyperledger
            Fabrics} and \textbf{Software Guard Extension}
    \end{itemize}

\item
    AI Game-playing bot
    $\mid$
    Prof. Mausam
    \hfill
    OCT $2018$

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item
            Created a bot to play Yinsh, a $2-$player game on an hexagonal board
            with a branching factor of $30$.
        \item
            Used \textbf{Alpha beta pruning} with \textbf{static move ordering}
            to decide next move from set of all possible moves.
        \item
            Utilized \textbf{Bitboards} and \textbf{Zobrist Hashing} to speed up
            move generation, thus searching $4$ moves ahead.
    \end{itemize}

\item
    Toy prolog interpreter
    $\mid$
    Prof. Sanjiva Prasad
    \hfill
    MAR $2018$

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item
            Built a interpreter for logic programming language - Prolog, capable
            of solving prolog predicates.
        \item
            The front end of the interpreter consitutes of the \textbf{Lex
            scanner} (ocamllex) and \textbf{LALR parser} (ocamlyacc).
        \item
            The scanner converts the program into tokens which in turn are
            converted into \textbf{Abstract Syntax Tree}.
        \item
            A explicit \textbf{backtracking algorithm} using fixed size stacks
            was implemented to solve the predicates.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
